# Getting Started with Wispn

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### 'npm run backend'
and only then run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) to view the backend API queries in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
